# Troy's-Pancake-Queue

This repository holds a simple web application that creates a wait list (queue) of people who enter their information. The project was created for San Jose State University's Software and Computer Engineering Society. The organization holds "Pancake Thursdays" where an officer of the club makes and serves pancakes to the public. This web application was made for people to queue their names and wait for delicious pancakes to be served to them.
